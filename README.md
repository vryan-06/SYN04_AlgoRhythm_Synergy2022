## Problem Statement: 

### Transcript Portal  üñ•Ô∏è : <br>
A website/app where students from all years can fill applications for
their transcripts. Students should be able to fill applications for their transcripts online.
The application will go to the TPO for approval. Once the TPO approves it through the
portal, the student can then make their payment online or in person. Once all the
requirements are met, the exam cell will initiate the process of getting the transcripts
ready. The students should be notified once their transcripts are ready to be collected.
